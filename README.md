# Convert List to Semicolon-Separated String

This is a simple Python script that converts a list of values (copied to the clipboard) into a semicolon-separated string. The converted string is then copied back to the clipboard, making it easy to use in applications or scripts requiring a specific format for search or input.

## Features
- Converts a multi-line list to a single line string with values separated by semicolons (`;`).
- Uses the clipboard for input and output, streamlining the process.
- Prints the resulting string for quick verification.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The `pyperclip` library for clipboard interaction. Install it with:
  ```bash
  pip install pyperclip
